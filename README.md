# Eye-Controlled-Mouse-Using-Face-Mesh-Detection

This Python script leverages the capabilities of the MediaPipe library for face mesh detection to create an innovative "Eye-Controlled Mouse" system. The script utilizes a webcam to capture real-time video frames, and through facial landmarks, it tracks the movement of the user's eyes. By analyzing specific points around the eyes, the script translates these movements into corresponding cursor actions on the screen. The user can control the mouse pointer by moving their eyes, and a subtle blink gesture triggers a mouse click. This interaction provides a hands-free and intuitive alternative for computer control, offering accessibility and convenience. The "Eye-Controlled Mouse" script seamlessly integrates facial landmark detection with the PyAutoGUI library, demonstrating the potential of computer vision in developing novel and user-friendly human-computer interaction systems.
